# fluorescence_cell_generator
This is the repo for a synthetic image generator to generate image and labeled image pairs of yeast cells under fluorescence microscopy.

There are three part in the matlab file 

1. my cell generating algorithm + true segmentation label 
2. two existing generating algorithm + true segmentation label 
3. comparison of two existing segmentation algorithm cellprofiler and cellpose

UI?? 
Deep learning generation? require the training of using real image
